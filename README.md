# CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Java-Web-Application-Deployment

Objectives:

Efficiency: Automate the build, test, and deployment process of a basic Java website.
Version Control: Implement Git for collaborative development and code versioning.
Standardization: Use Docker to create a reproducible environment for the website.
Continuous Integration/Delivery: Use Jenkins to streamline the development cycle, ensuring rapid and reliable deployment.
Configuration Management: Leverage Ansible to automate infrastructure setup and deployments.

Prerequisites:

Familiarity with basic Java web development (Servlets, JSP)
Understanding of fundamental DevOps concepts.
Working environments:
Linux-based system (VM or physical machine) for Jenkins and Docker setup.
A separate system for simulating the production deployment environment (can be another Linux VM).

Project Structure:

Java Web Application

Create a simple Java application using Servlets and JSP (a "Hello World" with some static content would suffice).
Structure it as a Maven project for easier dependency management and building.

Git Repository

Set up a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to store the application code.
Establish branching workflow (e.g., 'develop' for development, 'master' for production-ready code).

Jenkins Setup

Install Jenkins.
Configure necessary plugins:
Git Plugin
Maven Plugin
Docker Pipeline Plugin
Ansible Plugin


Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile to package the web application:
Base Image: A Java-enabled image (e.g., tomcat:latest)
Instructions:
COPY the compiled web application (WAR file) into the Tomcat webapps directory.
EXPOSE the appropriate port (usually 8080 for Tomcat).

Jenkins Pipeline

Define a Jenkins pipeline with these stages:
Checkout: Clone the code from the Git repository.
Build: Use Maven to compile and package the application into a WAR file.
Test: (Optional but recommended) Execute basic unit or integration tests.
Build Docker Image: Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile.
Push Image: Push the built image to a Docker registry (Docker Hub or a private registry).
Ansible Deployment: Use an Ansible playbook to:
Connect to the target deployment server.
Ensure required dependencies (e.g., Docker service) are installed.
Pull the latest image from the registry.
Stop any existing container instances (if applicable).
Deploy the new container.


Ansible Playbook


Execution

Code Changes: A developer pushes code changes to the Git repository
Jenkins Trigger: Webhooks or polling in Jenkins detect the change and trigger the pipeline.
Automated Flow: Jenkins executes the pipeline, resulting in a new Docker image with the changes, and Ansible deploys that image to the production-like environment.

Create an Ansible playbook with relevant tasks, ensuring idempotency (safe to run multiple times).
